# Relictify

Relictify is an equipment tracking app for the game [Honkai: Star Rail](https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/)

The project aims to build a SPA web app that maintains parity with the in-game Character (Relics) menu.

Additionally, enhancements are planned to allow for easier theorycrafting and buildcrafting of characters.

## Technical Details

Relictify was originally built with [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor), with an [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet) backend.

The project is now undergoing a rewrite, and is slated to be built as a self-contained Single Page Application written in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) in TypeScript.

An API server exists to deliver configuration files to the client, written in [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and TypeScript. The API repository may be found [here](https://github.com/NekoDrone/relictify-api), but the API layer is not currently accepting contributions at this time.

## Usage
